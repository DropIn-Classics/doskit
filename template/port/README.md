# port: {{NAME}} in C

A native compatibility implementation requiring an installed copy of the
original game, on doskit's runtime (doskit/runtime). The game's data is
read from the player's copy at run time; none of it is in this
repository.

## State

Started {{DATE}} from doskit's template: finds or unpacks the game's
files and shows a text screen. Nothing of the game is translated yet.

## Build and run

    sh port/build.sh          # macOS, Linux (SDL2 for the window)
    port\build.bat            # Windows (MSVC)
    port/build/{{SLUG}} -game game

Both scripts define `PORT_VERSION` (a string) for the compiler when
there is a version: the environment's `PORT_VERSION`, else the tag of the
commit built; the workflow sets it for a tag's build. Without one it
stays undefined.
`PORT_UPDATE_URL` likewise, from the environment only: where a release
looks for newer ones (doskit/runtime/update.h); the workflow sets it to
the latest release's `latest.json`.

## Releases

`.github/workflows/build.yml` builds the packages doskit/docs/RELEASE.md
prescribes; a pushed tag `vX.Y` makes a release of them. `dist/README.txt`
is the players' README in each package: fill in the game's keys and
anything the game needs before the first release. `dist/uninstall.sh`
and `dist/uninstall.cmd` go into the packages as they are: they remove
what the port copied (doskit/docs/RELEASE.md, point 8).

## Checked
